# Hi, I'm Timur Medvedev üëã

I am a **Backend Developer** and **AppSec Engineer** üîí, passionate about building secure, scalable, and high-performance server-side systems. I specialize in backend development using **Python**, **Go**, **PHP**, **C**, and have experience working with **Linux**. My goal is to integrate security practices throughout the development lifecycle, creating reliable and secure applications. I'm also interested in emerging technologies like **neural networks** ü§ñ and actively exploring their applications in backend development.

## About Me

I am a developer striving to grow both in **backend development** and **application security**. My journey began with a deep interest in programming and security, and since then, I have been honing my skills in building secure and efficient systems.

My experience includes:

- **Backend Development (Python, Go, PHP, C):** I design, develop, and maintain server-side applications, create RESTful APIs, and optimize database performance. My expertise spans several programming languages, including **Python**, **Go**, **PHP**, and **C**, allowing me to build solutions for diverse challenges.
- **Application Security (AppSec):** I focus on applying best security practices, such as protection against SQL Injection, XSS, and adhering to secure coding standards throughout the development process.
- **Security Testing:** I actively develop skills in security testing, using tools like **OWASP ZAP** and **Burp Suite** for static and dynamic code analysis.
- **DevOps & CI/CD:** I integrate security into the development process using CI/CD tools like **GitHub Actions**, and I‚Äôm exploring cloud and container solutions with **Docker** üê≥.
- **Database & API Security:** I ensure the security of APIs, from secure authentication to data protection, following security principles such as **OWASP** recommendations.
- **Linux:** I have strong skills in working with **Linux** and use it for development, server administration, and addressing performance and security challenges.
- **Neural Networks:** In addition to development and security, I am passionate about neural networks and actively explore their use in backend development, such as for building recommendation systems, natural language processing, or creating smart APIs.

## My Approach

I follow a **shift-left** mentality in security, meaning I aim to integrate security measures from the very early stages of development. Security is not the final step; it‚Äôs an ongoing process that should be embedded throughout the development lifecycle. I actively collaborate with teams to ensure the applications we build are functional and resilient to attacks.

## Key Skills üîß

- **Programming Languages:** **Python**, **Go**, **PHP**, **C**
- **API Development:** Designing and building RESTful APIs
- **Databases:** SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL), NoSQL (MongoDB)
- **Security Testing:** Static and dynamic code analysis with tools like **OWASP ZAP** and **Burp Suite**
- **Application Security (AppSec):** Protection against vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, CSRF), data encryption
- **CI/CD:** Integrating security into the development process with **GitHub Actions**, **Docker**
- **Containerization:** Basics of working with **Docker**, creating secure containers
- **DevSecOps:** Implementing security principles in the DevOps process
- **Linux:** Experience with **Linux** for development, administration, and security.
- **Neural Networks:** Exploring the application of **neural networks** to solve problems in backend development and enhance app functionality.

## Biography üìñ

As a developer, I am continuously improving my technical skills while staying committed to **secure coding** and **cybersecurity**. I‚Äôm motivated to contribute to projects that emphasize security and performance. I‚Äôm particularly interested in working in teams that aim to build secure, reliable software and are eager to set new challenges for improving both my backend development and application security skills.

I‚Äôm also actively researching the field of **neural networks**, exploring their application in backend development, which allows me to blend traditional development approaches with cutting-edge technological trends.

## Education & Certifications üéì

- **Currently studying at Moscow Technical University of Communications and Informatics**
