# Hello, I'm Timur Medvedev ðŸ‘‹

I am a **Junior Backend Developer** and **Junior AppSec Engineer**, passionate about building secure, scalable, and high-performance backend systems. I specialize in backend development with **Python**, **Go**, and **PHP**, while also focusing on application security to ensure that security is integrated into every stage of the development lifecycle.

## About Me

As an entry-level professional in both backend development and application security, I am eager to learn and expand my skills in the following areas:

- **Backend Development (Python, Go, PHP):** I design and optimize server-side applications, create RESTful APIs, and work with databases (SQL, NoSQL). I use **Python**, **Go**, and **PHP** to build fast, efficient, and scalable backend solutions.
- **Application Security (AppSec):** I implement fundamental application security practices, such as preventing SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and ensuring secure coding standards are followed.
- **Security Testing:** I am learning to apply basic security testing techniques, including static and dynamic code analysis, using tools like **OWASP ZAP** and **Burp Suite**.
- **DevOps and CI/CD:** I aim to integrate security into the development pipeline by using CI/CD tools like **GitHub Actions** and leveraging cloud solutions and containerization (e.g., **Docker**).
- **Database and API Security:** I work with databases and design secure APIs, adhering to security principles and ensuring data protection.

## My Approach

I believe in a **shift-left** mentality when it comes to security, meaning I focus on integrating security practices from the very beginning of the development process. Security is not just a final step, but a continuous process throughout the entire development cycle.

My goal is to create reliable and secure applications that provide a high level of security and resilience against attacks. I am always eager to learn and improve my skills both in backend development and application security.

## Key Skills

- **Programming Languages:** **Python**, **Go**, **PHP**
- **API Development:** Designing and building RESTful APIs
- **Databases:** SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL), NoSQL (MongoDB)
- **Security Testing:** Static and dynamic code analysis, using tools like **OWASP ZAP** and **Burp Suite**
- **Application Security (AppSec):** Protection against vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, CSRF), data encryption
- **CI/CD:** Integrating security into development pipelines with **GitHub Actions**, **Docker**
- **Containerization:** Basics of working with **Docker**, creating secure containers
- **DevSecOps:** Implementing security principles into DevOps processes

## Education and Certifications

- [AppSec Certification (OWASP, CompTIA Security+, etc.)]
- [Python/Go/PHP Programming Certification]
